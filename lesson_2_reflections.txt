1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Git starts to track the directory and recognizes the folder as repository. Git commands such as log and status will now work. You need to do it to let Git know where the commited files will be.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is different because it caches the files that are ready to be commited to the repository. It allows you to specify individual files that you would like to commit to the repository instead of all files. It is an intermediary stage between the working directory and the final commited repository.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can use the staging area to track any changes and then you can see when you have made enough changes per one logical change. If you didn't have a staging area it would be hard to track what logical change you made.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Branches would be helpful for different language versions, experimental vs production builds, different localized versions, and different major add-ons.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The diagrams show where the branches start and where the commits can and cannot reach.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The primary branch, usually master branch, is the main branch where all the commits from the child branch are combined. They will be shown in chronological order. 
We represent it in the diagram the way that we do because we are showing what commits can and cannot be accessed by the merged branch and also to visualize the concept.
