1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You would want to use a remote repository when your code is ready to go live or you want other collaborators to have a look at it.

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You might want to pull changes manually because changes could have been introduced to the remote that you don't want implemented on your local branch.
